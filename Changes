0.06 Fri Nov 8 2002
    - finally found someone with a solaris box to work out reason for
      unexpected test failures. Thanks to John D. Robinson and Jeroen Latour
      Details available at: http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=211401
    - Removed another new bug relating to test scripts rather than core code
      thanks to the combined effors of Perlmonks tommyw, grinder, Jaap, vek,
      erasei, jlongino and strider_corinth
0.07 Sat Aug 2 2003
    - i admit to abject slackness, but anyway finally allocated a few hours
      to apply a number of bug fixes which are (in no particular order)
    - mod_perl compliant, patched by Mathew Albright
        - still need to comment out use Selfloader and __DATA__ token
        - still thinking about other solutions to this
    - Blessed globs now possible in the constructor thanks to chromatic
    - Unicode error  0xfe |  ($c >> 30) -> 0xfc | ($c >>30 ) fixed thanks to
      Thomas L. Shinnick
    - s/$value ||= 0/$value = defined $value ? $value : ''/ in raw_fetch() method
      in Cookie.pm to allow value 0.
    - Added missing $VERSION to Util.pm
    - Added P3P support as suggested by Marc Bauer (parallels CGI.pm)
        - updated header() and redirect() methods in Simple.pm
0.071 Sat Aug 2 2003
    - Oops, changed $VERSION to 0.007 not 0.07 so have to change to 0.071 to
      upload again. ;-)
    - no significant changes since 0.07 (aka 0.007) ;-)
0.072 Tue Sept 9 2003
    - Patched issue with large POSTs where data may not be on STDIN for single
      read call. Bug exists in CGI.pm as well. Thanks to Jason Luther
    - Added tests for slow post behaviour
0.075 Tue June 1 2004
    - Meant to upload 0.73 and 0.074 but just never got around to it
    - Fixed upload hang bug in certain circumstances
    - Added upload_fieldnames() method by request
    - Added support for $fh = upload('field_name') but this has the issue
      of what to do if 'field_name' is duplicated. You can only ever get one
      fh from this method unlike the favoured approach using param() to get
      the filename(s) which will let you get to all the files.
    - José Micó deserves plaudits as does PodMaster.
0.076
    - Went missing in action.
0.077 Tue 23 Nov 2004
    - Bugfix patches.
    - José Micó supplied patch that relates to character set allowed in headers.
      TAB and high ascii chars are definitivelly allowed in headers, and not
      accepting them prevents the upload of files with filenames like "España.txt".
    - José Micó also notes that some versions of IE send extra boundaries in
      POSTed data before real ones. New patch should be fix this IE issue.
    - Lars Thegler supplied some patches.
        - head2/head3 pod changed to head1/head2 for the benefit of some older
          tools that exepect this.
        - Resolved issue with manpages not being installed on FREEBSD via Makefile
          hack
    - Steve Purkis supplied a patch for a serious POST_MAX bug. A small modification
      to control flow was used instead but this was a serious bug. If you are reading
      this you are probably upgrading which is good.
